# ðŸ’¬ ðŸš€ Serving LLM based Chatbot

This repository provides a generalized serving framework to serve LLM based application(currently aiming Chatbot). This is a fork project of [Alpaca-LoRA-Serve](https://github.com/deep-diver/Alpaca-LoRA-Serve). Alpaca-LoRA-Serve was initially written heavily dependent on Alpaca model, so it was not so easy to extend to support other models. In this project, I am going to refactor the code base a lot to make it concise and clean with the help of the other library that I built([Ping Pong or Bong Bong](https://github.com/deep-diver/PingPong))

## Todo
- [ ] Structure project
- [ ] Support Alpaca based application 
- [ ] Support GPT-Alpaca based application
- [ ] Support Flan based application
- [ ] Support Dolly based application
- [ ] Support backend only option (w/ FastAPI)
- [ ] Dockerfile
